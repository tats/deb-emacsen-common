emacsen-common (1.4.12) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Emergency changes to startup policy.  We're reverting for now to the
    old behavior because the new way breaks too many things, and we need
    to release.  Please see debian-emacs-policy's bits about
    debian-emacs-flavor for details, and sorry for the short notice.

emacsen-common (1.4.11) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Upload to frozen to match emacs20 bugfix upload for frozen.  Without
    this the frozen emacs20 is uninstallable. (Closes: Bug#64648)
  * Hopefully accomodate bug in xemacs packages with strange hack.  This
    will work around the current problem, but xemacs still needs some
    fixing. (Closes: Bug#61161  Bug#61080 Bug#61110 Bug#61133 Bug#61157) 
  * Update debian-emacs-policy to be stricter about startup behaviors and
    to more clearly indicate what I really meant.  Since no one's
    responded to my proposal on debian-emacsen, I guess there are no
    objections :> Feel free to bring this up later if you have a
    problem...

emacsen-common (1.4.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved debian-emacs-flavor here from emacs20.  Other emacsen
    maintainers note, you should not declare this in your packages
    anymore.  It is now set by debian-startup automatically from its
    argument.  See debian-emacs-policy for details.
  * Fix problem in args to install-info in postinst. (Closes: Bug#25196)
  * Get /usr/local/... permissions right. (Closes: Bug#25913)
  * Fix bashism in postrm. (Closes: Bug#41967 Bug#50674)
  * Remove symlinks from package so I can put it under CVS.

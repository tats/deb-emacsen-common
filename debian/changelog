emacsen-common (2.0.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Require add-on packages to depend on emacsen-common >= 2.0.8.  This
    should be simpler and safer, and emacsen-common is only ~140k, which
    shouldn't be too big a burden.

    One specific problem this solves is the handling of
    /var/lib/emacsen-common when emacsen-common is purged -- in particular
    /var/lib/emacsen-common/state/package/installed/*.  Without the
    dependency, emacsen-common can't remove the tree without clobbering
    the state for every add-on, but if emacsen-common can't remove it, who
    can?

    This release changes the following requirements for add-on packages
    (see debian-emacs-policy for the details):

      - They must now depend on emacsen-common >= 2.0.8.
      - They don't need to conflict with emacsen-common anymore.
      - They don't need to guard their calls to emacs-install-package.
      - They don't need to guard their calls to emacs-remove-package.
      - They should no longer manage their package/installed/ file directly.

    In addition emacsen flavor packages should now depend on
    emacsen-common >= 2.0.8.

  * emacs-package-install: don't try to validate the package during the preinst.
    The package files that we're looking for won't be available.
    Thanks to Tatsuya Kinoshita <tats@vega.ocn.ne.jp> for the report.
    (Closes: 736062)

  * emacs-package-remove: remove unused context variable.

emacsen-common (2.0.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix typo; add missing "-m" to mkdir call in postinst and policy.
    Thanks to Stefan Lippers-Hollmann <s.L-H@gmx.de> for the report.
    (Closes: 735155)

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>  Mon, 13 Jan 2014 11:00:10 -0600

emacsen-common (2.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use given/when syntax in emacs-install and
    emacs-package-install.  It's experimental and produces warnings with
    Perl 5.18.  Thanks to Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org> for the
    report.  (Closes: 723157)

  * sample-package-remove-foo: don't fail if elc_dir is already gone.
    Thanks to Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au> for the suggestion.
    (Closes: 711915)

  * Complain loudly if an add-on package appears to be broken.  Add
    validate_add_on_pkg() to verify that an add-on package's invocations
    match its "style", and call it from emacs-package-install and
    emacs-package-remove.

  * Ensure there are no duplicates in get_installed_add_on_packages()
    result.

  * Check dpkg exit status when reading package status.

  * emacs-install: mark emacsen flavor available before handling all the
    add-ons.

  * Check for unlink errors when handling emacsen flavor installed state
    file.

  * emacs-install/emacs-remove: stop messing with package installed state
    files.  That was just wrong -- the installed state file only indicates
    that a package is ready to go (i.e. it's safe to start calling the
    install/remove scripts).  It has nothing to do with emacsen flavors.

  * emacs-install/emacs-remove: treat each add-on as old/new case-by-case.
    Whether or not an add-on package is old or new is a property of the
    package itself.  The old or new status of the emacsen flavor is
    irrelevant.

  * Check for unlink errors when handling an add-on's installed state
    file.

  * Fix handling of add-on package installed state file.  Mark an add-on
    package as ready (installed) sooner, and wait until after all of the
    relevant removals before marking an add-on as unavailable.  Note that
    the state file is only intended to indicate that the package is ready
    for processing by emacsen-common.

  * debian-emacs-policy: require add-on postinst/prerm to handle state
    directly.  Add-on packages must now maintain their installed/<package>
    file directly from their postinst/prerm scripts.  This should fix a
    race whenever emacsen-common and an add-on package are being installed
    at the same time (i.e. perhaps via "apt-get install add-on emacs24").
    If the add-on's postinst goes first, its emacsen install script won't
    be run.

  * debian-emacs-policy: change conflicts requirement from "<" to "<<".

emacsen-common (2.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't ignore dependency install scripts in emacs-package-install.  The
    previous code didn't actually update the script name properly in the
    loop where it was trying to install all of an add-on package's
    dependencies.  As a result, none of the dependencies' install scripts
    were actually invoked. Thanks to Sébastien Villemot
    <sebastien@debian.org> for tracking down the problem, and providing
    the patch. (closes: #693472)

  * Invoke each add-on install script correctly as new-style or old-style.
    Previously, emacs-package-install would invoke all of the add-on
    install scripts in a dependency chain as either old-style or
    new-style, based solely on whether or not the package that triggered
    the install was old-style or new-style.  Now it should invoke each
    package's install script based on whether the package itself is
    new-style or old-style, as determined by the presence or absence of
    the policy-required /usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/compat/PACKAGE
    file.  Thanks to Sébastien Villemot <sebastien@debian.org> for the
    report.  (closes: #693472)

emacsen-common (2.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use the obsolete calc package as a policy example.
    Thanks to "A. N. Other" <a.n.other.debian@gmail.com> for the report.
    (closes: #674181)

  * Don't override /usr/local/* load-path entries in debian-run-directories.
    Previously, debian-run-directories would prepend all of the add-on
    package paths to load-path, which meant that (in violation of Debian
    policy) /usr/local wouldn't preceed the other entries.
    Thanks to Hendrik Tews <hendrik@askra.de> for the report and Kevin
    Ryde <user42@zip.com.au> for an initial suggested patch -- posted to
    #454778. (closes: #676424)

emacsen-common (2.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move #DEBHEPLER# up in the postinst to avoid an emacs complaint about
    a missing /usr/local/emacs/site-lisp during the emacsen-common package
    install script.

    to more clearly indicate the cause of an install/remove failure.

    Thanks to Adam Borowski <kilobyte@angband.pl> and Ondřej Surý
    <ondrej@debian.org> for the report. (Closes: #672874)

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>  Mon, 14 May 2012 19:15:57 -0500

emacsen-common (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the requirement that add-on packages depend on emacsen or
    emacsen-common.  This should eliminate the need for many of the
    trivial Debian foo-el packages, but before the dependencies can be
    removed, an add-on package must be changed to follow the updated
    debian-emacs-policy.

  * Treat the failure of any add-on package install or remove script as a
    fatal error.  Otherwise inter-add-on package dependencies won't be
    respected.

  * Migrate to debhelper.

  * Update debian-file->string to use insert-file-contents-literally.
    Change gnus-nntpserver-file defvar to setq.  Thanks to Jari Aalto
    <jari.aalto@poboxes.com>. (closes: 269155)

  * Always call debian-run-directories.  Previously a bug would prevent it
    from running if debian-emacs-flavor wasn't set.  Thanks to Francesco
    Potorti` <pot@gnu.org> and Andrew Kemp <ajwk@pell.uklinux.net>.
    (closes: 222518, 136779)

  * Thanks to Agustin Martin Domingo <agmartin@debian.org> for collecting

  * Remove "Conflicts: emacs".  If I recall correctly, this dates back to
    a time when the Emacs binary package was just named "emacs"
    (i.e. unversioned), and before the creation of emacsen-common and the
    Debian Emacs Policy.  The Conflicts should be safe to remove now, and
    the removal will allow us to create a new emacs-defaults source
    package (a la gcc-defaults) that will produce an emacs package that
    always depends on the current "standard" version of Emacs
    (i.e. emacs21, emacs22, etc.).
  * Update to Standards-Version to 3.6.2.

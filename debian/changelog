emacsen-common (3.0.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Conflict with xemacs21-support (<< 21.4.24-6~).  Restore conflict with
    xemacs21-support, but version it to exclude everything before the
    emacsen-common 3.0 compatibility patches were applied.  Thanks to
    Adrian Bunk for reporting the issue.

    David Bremner for reporting the problem. (Closes: 902208)

  * emacsen-common.maintstripts: update rm_conffile versions.  Apparently

emacsen-common (3.0.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Accommodate the unversioning of the Emacs packages, i.e. emacs25 is
    becoming emacs.

  * Improve sample packaging scripts (quoting, etc.).

  * Remove 00debian-vars.el.  Rely on flavors to set the mail-host-address
    and gnus-nntpserver-file values themselves, when appropriate.

  * Adjust policy to reflect dissolution of shared emacs metaflavor.
    There will no longer be a shared emacs metaflavor -- the emacs25
    package is planning to "unversion" to become the concrete emacs
    flavor.

  * Update debian/compat to 10.

  * Conflict with older emacsen flavors.  Given the dissolution of the
    emacs metaflavor and the unversioning of the emacs25 package, conflict
    with the core package in all previous emacsen flavors so that we can
    manage the transition without having to carry around a lot of
    duplicated compatibility code here, and/or in the various flavors.

  * Clean up emacsen-common install and remove.

  * Move debian-startup.el to share/emacsen-common.

  * Drop /etc/emacs/site-start.el.

  * Remove vestigial debian-emacs-flavor handling.

  * Don't run emacs/site-start.d anymore.

  * Drop /usr/local/emacs/site-lisp.

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>  Sat, 19 May 2018 14:03:17 -0500

emacsen-common (2.0.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Require add-on packages to depend on emacsen-common >= 2.0.8.  This
    should be simpler and safer, and emacsen-common is only ~140k, which
    shouldn't be too big a burden.

    One specific problem this solves is the handling of
    /var/lib/emacsen-common when emacsen-common is purged -- in particular
    /var/lib/emacsen-common/state/package/installed/*.  Without the
    dependency, emacsen-common can't remove the tree without clobbering
    the state for every add-on, but if emacsen-common can't remove it, who
    can?

    This release changes the following requirements for add-on packages
    (see debian-emacs-policy for the details):

      - They must now depend on emacsen-common >= 2.0.8.
      - They don't need to conflict with emacsen-common anymore.
      - They don't need to guard their calls to emacs-install-package.
      - They don't need to guard their calls to emacs-remove-package.
      - They should no longer manage their package/installed/ file directly.

    In addition emacsen flavor packages should now depend on
    emacsen-common >= 2.0.8.

  * emacs-package-install: don't try to validate the package during the preinst.
    The package files that we're looking for won't be available.
    Thanks to Tatsuya Kinoshita <tats@vega.ocn.ne.jp> for the report.
    (Closes: 736062)

  * emacs-package-remove: remove unused context variable.

emacsen-common (2.0.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix typo; add missing "-m" to mkdir call in postinst and policy.
    Thanks to Stefan Lippers-Hollmann <s.L-H@gmx.de> for the report.
    (Closes: 735155)

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>  Mon, 13 Jan 2014 11:00:10 -0600

emacsen-common (2.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use given/when syntax in emacs-install and
    emacs-package-install.  It's experimental and produces warnings with
    Perl 5.18.  Thanks to Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org> for the
    report.  (Closes: 723157)

  * sample-package-remove-foo: don't fail if elc_dir is already gone.
    Thanks to Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au> for the suggestion.
    (Closes: 711915)

  * Complain loudly if an add-on package appears to be broken.  Add
    validate_add_on_pkg() to verify that an add-on package's invocations
    match its "style", and call it from emacs-package-install and
    emacs-package-remove.

  * Ensure there are no duplicates in get_installed_add_on_packages()
    result.

  * Check dpkg exit status when reading package status.

  * emacs-install: mark emacsen flavor available before handling all the
    add-ons.

  * Check for unlink errors when handling emacsen flavor installed state
    file.

  * emacs-install/emacs-remove: stop messing with package installed state
    files.  That was just wrong -- the installed state file only indicates
    that a package is ready to go (i.e. it's safe to start calling the
    install/remove scripts).  It has nothing to do with emacsen flavors.

  * emacs-install/emacs-remove: treat each add-on as old/new case-by-case.
    Whether or not an add-on package is old or new is a property of the
    package itself.  The old or new status of the emacsen flavor is
    irrelevant.

  * Check for unlink errors when handling an add-on's installed state
    file.

  * Fix handling of add-on package installed state file.  Mark an add-on
    package as ready (installed) sooner, and wait until after all of the
    relevant removals before marking an add-on as unavailable.  Note that
    the state file is only intended to indicate that the package is ready
    for processing by emacsen-common.

  * debian-emacs-policy: require add-on postinst/prerm to handle state
    directly.  Add-on packages must now maintain their installed/<package>
    file directly from their postinst/prerm scripts.  This should fix a
    race whenever emacsen-common and an add-on package are being installed
    at the same time (i.e. perhaps via "apt-get install add-on emacs24").
    If the add-on's postinst goes first, its emacsen install script won't
    be run.

  * debian-emacs-policy: change conflicts requirement from "<" to "<<".

emacsen-common (2.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't ignore dependency install scripts in emacs-package-install.  The
    previous code didn't actually update the script name properly in the
    loop where it was trying to install all of an add-on package's
    dependencies.  As a result, none of the dependencies' install scripts
    were actually invoked. Thanks to Sébastien Villemot
    <sebastien@debian.org> for tracking down the problem, and providing
    the patch. (closes: #693472)

  * Invoke each add-on install script correctly as new-style or old-style.
    Previously, emacs-package-install would invoke all of the add-on
    install scripts in a dependency chain as either old-style or
    new-style, based solely on whether or not the package that triggered
    the install was old-style or new-style.  Now it should invoke each
    package's install script based on whether the package itself is
    new-style or old-style, as determined by the presence or absence of
    the policy-required /usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/compat/PACKAGE
    file.  Thanks to Sébastien Villemot <sebastien@debian.org> for the
    report.  (closes: #693472)

    Thanks to "A. N. Other" <a.n.other.debian@gmail.com> for the report.
    (closes: #674181)

  * Don't override /usr/local/* load-path entries in debian-run-directories.
    Previously, debian-run-directories would prepend all of the add-on
    package paths to load-path, which meant that (in violation of Debian
    policy) /usr/local wouldn't preceed the other entries.
    Thanks to Hendrik Tews <hendrik@askra.de> for the report and Kevin
    Ryde <user42@zip.com.au> for an initial suggested patch -- posted to
    #454778. (closes: #676424)

  * Move #DEBHEPLER# up in the postinst to avoid an emacs complaint about
    a missing /usr/local/emacs/site-lisp during the emacsen-common package
    install script.

  * Report something like "ERROR: install script from foo package failed"
    to more clearly indicate the cause of an install/remove failure.

emacsen-common (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the requirement that add-on packages depend on emacsen or
    emacsen-common.  This should eliminate the need for many of the
    trivial Debian foo-el packages, but before the dependencies can be
    removed, an add-on package must be changed to follow the updated
    debian-emacs-policy.

  * Treat the failure of any add-on package install or remove script as a
    fatal error.  Otherwise inter-add-on package dependencies won't be
    respected.

  * Migrate to debhelper.

  * Always call debian-run-directories.  Previously a bug would prevent it
    from running if debian-emacs-flavor wasn't set.  Thanks to Francesco

  * Remove "Conflicts: emacs".  If I recall correctly, this dates back to
    a time when the Emacs binary package was just named "emacs"
    (i.e. unversioned), and before the creation of emacsen-common and the
    Debian Emacs Policy.  The Conflicts should be safe to remove now, and
    the removal will allow us to create a new emacs-defaults source
    package (a la gcc-defaults) that will produce an emacs package that
    always depends on the current "standard" version of Emacs
    (i.e. emacs21, emacs22, etc.).

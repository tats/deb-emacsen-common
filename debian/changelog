  * Move the sample package install/remove scripts from
    debian-emacs-policy to the files sample-package-install-foo and
    sample-package-remove-foo in /usr/share/doc/emacsen-common.

  * Fix some suspicious code in the sample package install/remove scripts.
    Thanks to Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>. (closes: 424940)

emacsen-common (1.4.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add --no-site-file and --no-init-file for the compilation of
    emacsen-common's .elc files.  Those options should be fine for
    emacsen-common itself right now.  Thanks to Peter S Galbraith
    <psg@debian.org>.  (closes: 132355)

  * Fix minor documentation bug.  Thanks to Roland Stigge
    <stigge@antcom.de>. (closes: 208414)

  * Print the error message when debian-run-directories encounters an
    error while loading a file.  Thanks to Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>.

emacsen-common (1.4.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove "Conflicts: emacs".  If I recall correctly, this dates back to
    a time when the Emacs binary package was just named "emacs"
    (i.e. unversioned), and before the creation of emacsen-common and the
    Debian Emacs Policy.  The Conflicts should be safe to remove now, and
    the removal will allow us to create a new emacs-defaults source
    package (a la gcc-defaults) that will produce an emacs package that
    always depends on the current "standard" version of Emacs
    (i.e. emacs21, emacs22, etc.).
  * Update to Standards-Version to 3.6.2.

emacsen-common (1.4.16) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix sarge RC bug.  Alter debian-pkg-add-load-path-item to handle nil
    in load-path.  Thanks to Manoj Srivastava.  (closes: 270388)
  * Include section and priorty in dpkg-gencontrol generated control file.
    (closes: 288752)
  * Don't create /usr/doc/ symlinks anymore.
  * Remove pause in 00debian-vars.el when there is no /etc/mailname.  The
    message will always be available in *Messages*.  The real fix for this
    may involve bug 149924.  (closes: 115116)
  * Ignore *~ when generating package list.  Eventually we may do
    something more like run-parts, but this is at least an improvement.
    (ref: #29494)
  * Make the package description a bit more elaborate.  (closes: 209469)
  * Fix debian-emacs-policy typo.  (closes: 175779)

    policy. (closes: Bug#132842)
  * don't use dolist (not defined everywhere by default).
    (closes: Bug#132352)
  * document debian-pkg-add-load-path-item better and fix to actually
    modify load-path. (closes: Bug#134464)
  * make debian-unique-strings iterative since elisp isn't as recursion
    friendly as we might like. (closes: Bug#131803)
  * for now, issue a descriptive error message if emacsen-common is used
    before it's configured.

  * policy(9): /usr/share/emacs/<upstream>/site-lisp should not exist.
  * policy(9): all emacsen must have
    /usr/share/emacsen-common/mark-end-local in their load-path in the
    right place.
  * policy(9): add-on packages must use debian-pkg-add-load-path-item to

  * fix non-idempotentency in prerm. (closes: #96702)

  * Remove execute permission from conffiles file. (closes: #61303)

emacsen-common (1.4.12) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Emergency changes to startup policy.  We're reverting for now to the
    old behavior because the new way breaks too many things, and we need
    to release.  Please see debian-emacs-policy's bits about
    debian-emacs-flavor for details, and sorry for the short notice.

emacsen-common (1.4.11) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Upload to frozen to match emacs20 bugfix upload for frozen.  Without
    this the frozen emacs20 is uninstallable. (Closes: Bug#64648)
  * Hopefully accomodate bug in xemacs packages with strange hack.  This
    will work around the current problem, but xemacs still needs some
    fixing. (Closes: Bug#61161  Bug#61080 Bug#61110 Bug#61133 Bug#61157) 
  * Update debian-emacs-policy to be stricter about startup behaviors and
    to more clearly indicate what I really meant.  Since no one's
    responded to my proposal on debian-emacsen, I guess there are no
    objections :> Feel free to bring this up later if you have a
    problem...

emacsen-common (1.4.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved debian-emacs-flavor here from emacs20.  Other emacsen
    maintainers note, you should not declare this in your packages
    anymore.  It is now set by debian-startup automatically from its
    argument.  See debian-emacs-policy for details.
  * Fix problem in args to install-info in postinst. (Closes: Bug#25196)
  * Get /usr/local/... permissions right. (Closes: Bug#25913)
  * Fix bashism in postrm. (Closes: Bug#41967 Bug#50674)
  * Remove symlinks from package so I can put it under CVS.
